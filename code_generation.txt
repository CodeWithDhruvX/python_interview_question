✅ Tone and Style Guidelines:

Use spoken-style Hinenglish, like you're casually explaining something to a friend or junior developer.

Keep the language simple, friendly, and natural.

Use relatable examples (especially ones an Indian beginner would connect with, like classroom explanations, job interviews, or real coding tasks).

Avoid complicated words or phrases that sound too formal or western.

use any Hinglish — keep it 100% HinEnglish, but Indian-friendly.

Maintain a teacher-like tone, as if guiding someone new to programming.

🎯 Instructions:

Start with the first script:
