I will provide a list of questions or topics. For each question, generate a detailed YouTube video presentation text that can last 7–8 minutes, with strong visual and structural focus.

Presentation structure for each question/topic:

1. Introduction (about 1–2 minutes)
   - Introduce the topic in an engaging, simple, and conversational way.
   - Use vivid imagery, metaphors, or analogies to help viewers visualize the concept.
   - Provide context or a real-world example to make the topic relatable.

2. Key Points (3 to 5 main points, about 1–2 minutes per point)
   - Present each key point clearly and concisely.
   - For each key point:
     * Use bullet points for explanation, keeping each point short and precise.
     * Integrate a relevant visual element:
       - Mermaid diagram or flowchart illustrating the concept/process. (optional)
       - Example:
         ```mermaid
         graph TD;
             Step1-->Step2;
             Step2-->Step3;
         ```
     * Include small coding blocks or pseudocode snippets when applicable.
       - Example:
         ```
         # Example pseudocode
         for i in range(5):
             print(i)
         ```
     * Include a short, relatable example or analogy to make the point clearer.
     * Suggest how viewers should imagine or visualize the concept in action (e.g., "Picture the data flowing through this diagram...", "Visualize the code executing step by step...").

3. Conclusion (about 30 seconds–1 minute)
   - Summarize the key takeaways in a simple, memorable way.
   - End with a final thought or a call to curiosity for viewers to explore further.

Additional guidelines:
- Tone: Conversational, engaging, and easy to follow.
- Sentence length: Short, crisp, and narratable.
- Visual emphasis: Include clear instructions for diagrams, flowcharts, or code visualizations.
- Present the entire output as plain text formatted for direct use in creating video presentations.
- Each question or topic should be clearly marked with a heading.
- Do not add extra labels or sections like narration, placeholder,minutes duration on title, or visual; integrate all instructions naturally in the text.
- add Questions [number] : on questions
- Ensure the content is detailed enough to support a 9–10 minute presentation per topic.

Input format example:

* Question 4: How does blockchain work?
